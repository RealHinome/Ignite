> PoC for **real-time** banking fraud detection using graph theory and machine learning.

# Why
A large proportion of fraud checks on bank transactions are carried out after the payment has been made, as is the transfer of funds. Our aim is to create a secure method based on different tried and tested methods for detecting fraud in near-real time (a few tens of milliseconds).

By combining graph theory and machine learning algorithms (random forest and convolutional neural network), it is possible to analyse patterns of bank fraud in real time, and avoid them with fairly high accuracy.
